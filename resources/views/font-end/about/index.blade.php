    <p >Clear and Effective Communication of Word of ALLAH</p>
    
    <p>Alhamdulillah, this organization starts its journey to initiate a clear and effective communication of word of ALLAH. That was the mission of the Prophets ( peace be upon them) given by ALLAH.</p>
     
    <p>Science of effective communication in Arabic is called balagh. The idea behind balagh is when somebody says word, words are like loaded pistol. Words like weapons. The target for this weapon is your heart, your emotions, your feelings, your opinions that rest in your heart. That is the target of someone’s words. So they (messengers) have used kinds of words that can penetrate security of your cheast, the ribcage that is there. Get through your ears, penetrated to your cheast make it all way deep inside your heart and affect that heart, then that is Balagh. Balagh is not just communication does not even begin to cover it. We are talking about heart penetrating, Tran formative communication.</p> 
    
    <p>We are talking about we are going to speak in a way that is the most effective possibly. Now even though we are going to speak the most effective words, where is the change itself come from? Does it come from our words? The change comes from ALLAH. Indeed HE gives life to the death.. he is the one who resituates the heart. Then why is he telling people to speak effective language? If ALLAH is going to do it then I don’t have to do much. That’s not how it works. The rule of ALLAH in this life is for everything including dawa, including inviting people to ALLAH is you have to be the very very best and most effective you possibly can be then ALLAH will say “Kun fa yakun..”. Allah does not give his “Kun fa yakun..” away for free. You have to give your best then HE will give you the result. You don’t give your best then HE refuge to give you the result. In other words, result does not come because I am the best or I am trying to be the best, the result come from Allah because HE feels I deserve that as a result of my effort.</p> 
    
    <p>So they (messengers) have to make Balagh happen, they have to make clear effective communication happen. For the Prohet (pbuh) this is relief because he actually doesn’t have to come up with any words, all the words that he needs to get the across is what? The Quran…it itself is balagh</p>
    
    <p><i>46:35 Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) apostles of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress?</i></p>
    
    <p>Mubin came from verb abana- means to separate. We are going to communicate to you in a way that it doesn’t only appeal your emotions and affects you, we are going to communicate to you in a way that separate truth from falsehood. That the ideas you have that you need to understand are no good are now clearly understood is no good. In other words somebody could give a speech that moves people’s heart but there might not have any clarity- clarity should be there to be mubin. You can give an effective speech and not say anything, it could happen.</p>
    
    <p>In AlBlaghu AlMubin phrase-  AlBlaghu means effective appeal to emotion/heart and AlMubin means effective appeal to intellect. Both of these need to be there. That is communication. If the communication is only academic, delivering information then mubin is there but no balagh. There should be balagh also. That is the legacy of Prophet (pbuh). </p>
    
    <p>We are committed to carry over the task of our Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - to proclaim (the message-Qur’an) in the clearest manner.</p>
